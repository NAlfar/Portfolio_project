Model Card

Input:
The input to the model consists of 64 features, representing 8 consecutive readings from 8 sensors placed on the skin surface to measure electrical activity produced by muscles. 
The data is colle acted at 200 Hz, resulting in each line representing 40ms of recorded EMG activity. 
The gestures are categorized into four classes: rock (0), scissors (1), paper (2), and ok (3).

Output:
The model outputs one of four gesture classes (0, 1, 2, or 3) based on the input EMG data.

Model Architecture:
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

Input layer reshaping the data into (8, 8, 1)
Conv2D layer with 32 filters and (3, 3) kernel size, using ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D layer with (2, 2) pool size
Flatten layer to convert 2D matrix to 1D vector
Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
Output Dense layer with 4 neurons and softmax activation
Performance
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy metrics. 
The model is trained and validated on a dataset comprising multiple recordings of the specified gestures. 
The summary graph indicates accuracy across varying configurations of the model, specifically the number of convolutional layers and filters. 
The highest accuracy achieved is approximately 96%.

Limitations
The model is trained on data recorded from a single individual's right forearm within a short timespan, which may limit its generalizability to other individuals or conditions. 
Additionally, it only recognizes four specific gestures, which restricts its applicability to broader gesture recognition tasks.

Trade-offs
The model's performance may degrade if applied to gestures not included in the training set or if used with data from different sensor placements or individuals. 
The choice of model architecture, such as the number of convolutional layers and filters, affects the balance between computational complexity and accuracy, as depicted in the performance graph.
